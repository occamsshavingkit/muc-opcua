# Worked example

End-to-end example: Codex writes the development specs, Claude Sonnet implements the feature, Codex reviews it, and Claude ingests the findings.

## Scenario

You are on `feat/magic-link-auth`.

- builder: Claude Code
- spec default: `codex-5.5:xhigh@normal`
- heavy spec default: `opus-4.7:1m@max`
- implementation default: `sonnet-4.6@high`
- review default: `codex-5.5:high@normal`
- subagent routing: `auto`, policy `balanced`
- reviewer surface: Codex CLI
- base ref: `main`
- package profile: `compact`
- spec dir: `specs/042-magic-link-auth`

## Timeline

| Step | Where | Action | Artifact |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Claude | `/multi-model-review:cross-review init` | `.cross-review/config.json` |
| 2 | Claude | `/multi-model-review:spec-handoff` | `spec-authoring-prompt.md`, `metadata.json` |
| 3 | terminal | run Codex 5.5 on the spec handoff | `spec-output.md` |
| 4 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 + plugin subagents | implement routed task slices and commit | source changes |
| 5 | Claude | `/multi-model-review:review-package` | `review-package.md`, `metadata.json` |
| 6 | terminal | `codex exec -m codex-5.5 --file ... > review-report.md`, or `codex exec --oss -m <local-model> --file ...` for a configured local provider | `review-report.md` |
| 7 | Claude | `/multi-model-review:apply-review` | fixes + `review-state.json` |
| 8 | Claude or shell | commit fixes | updated branch |

## 1. Initialize

```text
/multi-model-review:cross-review init \
  --spec codex-5.5:xhigh@normal \
  --spec-heavy opus-4.7:1m@max \
  --dev sonnet-4.6@high \
  --review codex-5.5:high@normal \
  --subagents auto
```

Answers:

- builder: `claude-code`
- spec default: `codex-5.5:xhigh@normal`
- heavy spec default: `opus-4.7:1m@max`
- implementation default: `sonnet-4.6@high`
- review default: `codex-5.5:high@normal`
- subagent routing: `auto`
- reviewer: `codex-cli`
- base ref: `main`
- package profile: `compact`
- spec dir: `specs/042-magic-link-auth`

## 2. Export the spec handoff

```text
/multi-model-review:spec-handoff 042-magic-link-auth --spec-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal
```

Example output:

```text
Spec handoff written to:
  .cross-review/spec-handoffs/20260421-1410-magic-link-auth/spec-authoring-prompt.md

Spec author model:
  codex-5.5

Spec author options:
  intelligence=very-high, reasoning=xhigh, speed=normal

Implementation model:
  claude-sonnet-4.6

Implementation options:
  workload=high, allow_silent_upgrade=false
```

Run Codex 5.5 against the prompt and review the returned `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` file blocks before applying them.

If subagent routing is enabled, `tasks.md` may include route hints:

```markdown
- [ ] T001 [route:scout] Map current auth routes, token storage, and rate-limit middleware.
- [ ] T002 [route:heavy-planner] Design the magic-link verification path and replay-prevention boundary.
- [ ] T003 [route:worker] Implement token issuance, verification, and focused tests.
- [ ] T004 [route:review-checker] Run a local read-only preflight against the spec and touched files.
```

Claude Code can then pick the matching plugin subagent. Scout runs on the fast model, planning uses the heavy model, implementation uses the configured dev model, and local preflight stays separate from the external Codex review.

## 3. Export the review package

```text
/multi-model-review:review-package --review-model codex-5.5:high@normal
```

The package is compact-first, so the reviewer sees:

- a spec brief
- a plan brief
- a task brief
- relevant rules
- a grouped diff manifest
- focused diff excerpts
- notes about omissions

Example output:

```text
Package written to:
  .cross-review/packages/20260421-1430-magic-link-auth/review-package.md

Profile:
  compact

Run the reviewer:
  codex exec -m codex-5.5 --file .cross-review/packages/20260421-1430-magic-link-auth/review-package.md > .cross-review/packages/20260421-1430-magic-link-auth/review-report.md

Local OSS alternative:
  codex exec --oss -m <local-model> --file .cross-review/packages/20260421-1430-magic-link-auth/review-package.md > .cross-review/packages/20260421-1430-magic-link-auth/review-report.md
```

## 4. Codex reviews it

Codex writes:

```markdown
## Context sufficiency
limited-but-actionable

## Verdict
changes-requested

## Summary
The magic-link flow is mostly implemented, but the verification path appears to use direct token comparison and the route-level rate limit required by the spec is missing.

## Findings

### F1
- severity: critical
- confidence: 92
- location: src/auth/verify.ts:34
- summary: Token comparison is not constant-time
- detail: The verification path compares secrets using direct equality, which leaks timing information.
- suggested_fix: Use a constant-time comparison helper.

### F2
- severity: major
- confidence: 85
- location: src/auth/routes.ts:12
- summary: Magic-link endpoint has no rate limit
- detail: The spec requires request throttling for the magic-link route.
- suggested_fix: Add route-level rate limiting middleware.
```

Because the context was `limited-but-actionable`, Claude can proceed without re-packaging.

## 5. Claude ingests the report

```text
/multi-model-review:apply-review
```

Claude presents a checklist, reads the cited files, proposes targeted edits, and applies them one at a time after confirmation. With subagent routing enabled, path-local fixes can go to `mmr-implementation-worker`, while a small local preflight can go to `mmr-review-checker` before the external re-review.

## 6. What happens if compact was not enough?

If Codex had written:

```markdown
## Context sufficiency
needs-full-package
```

Then the next step would be:

```text
/multi-model-review:review-package --full
```

Or, if only one area needed more depth:

```text
/multi-model-review:review-package --paths src/auth
```

That is the core compact-first loop:

1. small package first
2. explicit sufficiency signal
3. fuller package only when needed
