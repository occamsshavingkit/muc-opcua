# speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review

Spec Kit extension command: `/speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review`

Legacy Claude plugin command: `/multi-model-review:apply-review`

Consume a reviewer agent's `review-report.md` and walk through the findings.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Steps

When the work-assist orchestration layer is available, use it to plan and apply accepted fixes: Superpowers `systematic-debugging` and `subagent-driven-development` to plan, `/ulw` to batch independent findings, and omo to implement-and-verify. Fall back to the `mmr-*` subagents otherwise, keep every user confirmation gate intact, and never pass secrets into their prompts. See `skills/multi-model-review/SKILL.md` -> "Work-assist orchestration".

1. Locate the package.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path, use it.
   - Else pick the latest `.cross-review/packages/*/` that contains `review-report.md`.
   - If none exist, abort with: "No review-report.md found. Did the reviewer save its output?"

2. Parse `review-report.md` using `templates/review-report.md`.
   - `Context sufficiency`
   - `Verdict`
   - `Summary`
   - findings with:
     - `severity`
     - `confidence`
     - `location`
     - `summary`
     - `detail`
     - `suggested_fix`
   - Read `metadata.json` when present for:
     - `subagent_routing`
     - selected implementation model/options
     - package scope and path filters

3. Handle context sufficiency first.
   - If `Context sufficiency = needs-full-package`:
     - present the current findings
     - do not start broad edits yet
     - recommend `/multi-model-review:review-package --full`
     - if the findings are clearly path-local, recommend `/multi-model-review:review-package --paths <subset>`
     - stop unless the user explicitly wants to continue with the current report

4. Filter findings.
   - Default: drop findings with `confidence < 70`
   - `--min-confidence N` overrides
   - Group remaining findings by severity, then file

5. Present a numbered checklist.
   - Quote the reviewer's wording instead of paraphrasing it
   - Do not edit files yet

6. For each finding the user accepts:
   - read the target file at the cited line
   - propose one edit for that finding
   - if `subagent_routing.mode = auto` and the accepted finding is path-local, route the fix to `mmr-implementation-worker`
   - if the finding is cross-cutting, ambiguous, migration-heavy, or security-sensitive, ask `mmr-heavy-planner` for a remediation plan before editing
   - apply only after confirmation
   - if two findings touch the same line, re-read between edits
   - record status in `.cross-review/packages/<pkg>/review-state.json`

7. After the pass:
   - if subagent routing is enabled and changes were made, run `mmr-review-checker` for a read-only local preflight when the scope is small enough
   - summarize applied vs skipped findings
   - remind the user that a re-review means:
     - `/multi-model-review:review-package`
     - run the reviewer again

8. Finish with the Completion token report.
   - Append the `**Token, Headroom & RTK**` block from `skills/multi-model-review/SKILL.md` (section "Completion token report").
   - The ingest pass itself rarely gathers large shell output, so RTK and Headroom are often `used=no` here; read `rtk gain` and `headroom_stats` for any session savings, and read the package `metadata.json` `compressed_blocks` to credit what the earlier packaging compressed.
   - Report the two layers separately from measured stats only; never estimate, and keep secrets out of the report.

   ```text
   **Token, Headroom & RTK**
   - **RTK**: used=<yes|no> — saved ≈ <N> tok (<P>%) · via `rtk gain`
   - **Headroom**: used=<yes|no> — saved ≈ <N> tok (<P>%) · via `headroom_stats` / package `compressed_blocks`
   - **Combined saved**: ≈ <RTK+Headroom> tok   (only when both layers are measured)
   - **Work-assist** (orchestration, usage only): ulw=<used|n/a>, omo=<used|n/a>, lazycodex=<used|n/a>, superpowers=<used|n/a>
   - **Subagent routing** (usage only): scout=<used|n/a>, worker=<used|n/a>, heavy-planner=<used|n/a>, review-checker=<used|n/a>
   ```

## Guardrails

- Never auto-apply a `critical` finding without explicit confirmation.
- Never merge multiple findings into one edit.
- If the compact package was declared insufficient, prefer re-packaging before broad remediation.
- Do not use subagents to bypass user confirmation for review fixes.
