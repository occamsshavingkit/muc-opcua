# multi-model-review

Multi-model code review and model-routed Spec-Driven Development.

Write specs with one model, implement with another, and review with a different one. This plugin turns [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) plus your git diff into portable handoffs that any CLI-capable model can consume.

The spec author or reviewer does not need to share your current session. Each handoff lives on disk as markdown, and you run the other model yourself.

## Quick usage

Install as a Spec Kit extension, then initialize model routing in the target repository:

```text
specify extension add --dev /path/to/multi-model-review
/speckit.multi-model-review.cross-review init --spec codex-5.5:xhigh@normal --spec-heavy opus-4.7:1m@max --dev sonnet-4.6@high --review codex-5.5:high@normal --subagents auto
```

Create or refine Spec Kit artifacts, implement the generated tasks, and export a compact review package:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff 001-auth-rework --plan
/speckit.implement
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package 001-auth-rework
```

If Headroom MCP tools are available, the package command can compress oversized
raw blocks while keeping retrieval notes in the package metadata:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package 001-auth-rework --headroom auto
```

When subagent routing is enabled, tasks can include route hints so Claude Code chooses the right specialist and model automatically:

```markdown
- [ ] T001 [route:scout] Map the affected files and project rules.
- [ ] T002 [route:heavy-planner] Plan the cross-cutting API and migration changes.
- [ ] T003 [route:worker] Implement the scoped code and tests.
- [ ] T004 [route:review-checker] Run a local read-only preflight before external review.
```

Run the reviewer yourself, save `review-report.md`, then ingest accepted findings:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review
```

Claude Code plugin installs still expose the legacy command names such as `/multi-model-review:cross-review`.

## Why multi-model?

A model reviewing its own output often rationalizes. A different model brings:

- different priors
- different bug sensitivity
- different style and rule interpretation

Spec Kit is excellent at the single-agent flow:

- `/speckit.specify`
- `/speckit.plan`
- `/speckit.tasks`
- `/speckit.implement`

`multi-model-review` is the cross-model loop around that flow:

- a spec-authoring model creates or refines `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`
- the implementation model builds the feature
- the builder creates a review package
- the reviewer reads that package and writes `review-report.md`
- the builder ingests the report and applies fixes

## Spec Kit vs. `multi-model-review`

> **This is not a replacement for Spec Kit — it is a Spec Kit extension.** The honest comparison is *Spec Kit on its own* vs. *Spec Kit with this extension installed*. The question is not "which one," it is "do I want the cross-model review loop on top."

[GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) owns Spec-Driven Development: `/speckit.constitution` → `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.clarify` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks` → `/speckit.implement`, plus `/speckit.analyze` and `/speckit.checklist` for quality gates. It works with 30+ agents — but you pick **one** agent, and that single model drives the whole lifecycle, including any self-review. There is no built-in cross-model review step.

That single-agent design is exactly the gap this extension closes.

| Dimension | Spec Kit alone | Spec Kit + `multi-model-review` |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| SDD lifecycle (spec → plan → tasks → implement) | Owns it | Unchanged — still Spec Kit underneath |
| Models per feature | One agent drives everything | Spec, implementation, and review can each be a **different** model |
| Code review | The author model checks its own work (`/speckit.analyze`, `/speckit.checklist` are same-agent passes) | A **second** model reviews code it did not write |
| Handoff between agents | Tied to one live session | Portable `spec.md` / `plan.md` / `tasks.md` / diff packages on disk |
| Reviewer choice | n/a | Template-driven: Codex, Gemini, another Claude, Hermes, any CLI LLM |
| Review token cost | Carries the whole build session | Compact-first packages + optional Headroom compression |
| Finding hygiene | n/a | Confidence-gated, with a `Context sufficiency` escape hatch |
| External calls | n/a | None hidden — you run the reviewer yourself |

### Why add the cross-model loop?

A model that reviews its own output tends to **rationalize** it: same priors, same blind spots, same rule interpretation that produced the bug in the first place. Spec Kit's `/speckit.analyze` and `/speckit.checklist` help, but they are the *same agent* checking its own artifacts for consistency and coverage — not an independent second opinion.

A *different* model brings:

- different priors
- different bug sensitivity
- a different read of the same spec and rules

Spec Kit deliberately stays model-agnostic and single-agent. `multi-model-review` is the loop that makes "build with one model, review with another" a first-class, on-disk workflow.

### Example: same feature, two workflows

**Spec Kit alone** — one model, one session, self-review:

```text
/speckit.specify   "Add magic-link auth"
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement
# The same model that wrote the code is the one that "reviews" it —
# and signs off on its own timing-unsafe token comparison.
```

**Spec Kit + `multi-model-review`** — Codex authors the spec, Sonnet implements, a fresh Codex session (with no build context) reviews:

```text
# One-time routing setup
/speckit.multi-model-review.cross-review init \
  --spec codex-5.5:xhigh@normal \
  --dev sonnet-4.6@high \
  --review codex-5.5:high@normal

# 1. A strong reasoning model authors the durable artifacts
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff 042-magic-link-auth --spec-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal

# 2. Implement with the configured dev model (no silent upgrade)
/speckit.implement

# 3. Export a compact, portable review package
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package 042-magic-link-auth
```

Run the reviewer yourself, in its own terminal — a different model that never saw the build session:

```bash
PKG=.cross-review/packages/20260421-1430-magic-link-auth
codex exec -m codex-5.5 --file $PKG/review-package.md > $PKG/review-report.md

# Local OSS reviewer via Codex CLI, after `oss_provider` is configured in Codex:
codex exec --oss -m <local-model> --file $PKG/review-package.md > $PKG/review-report.md
```

```text
# 4. Ingest only the high-confidence findings and apply fixes
/speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review
```

The reviewer catches what the builder rationalized:

```markdown
### F1
- severity: critical
- confidence: 92
- location: src/auth/verify.ts:34
- summary: Token comparison is not constant-time
- suggested_fix: Use a constant-time comparison helper.
```

That finding came from a model that never saw the implementation session — which is the entire point.

### When Spec Kit alone is enough

- Solo prototypes and throwaway spikes, where a second opinion is not worth the round-trip.
- You only have one model available.

Reach for `multi-model-review` when correctness matters: security-sensitive changes, cross-cutting refactors, or anywhere "the author graded their own homework" is a risk you want to remove.

## Recommended model routing

| Stage | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Spec authoring | `codex-5.5:xhigh@normal` | Deep reasoning, normal speed |
| Heavy spec authoring | `opus-4.7:1m@max` | Large audits and 1M-context passes |
| Implementation | `sonnet-4.6@high` | Token-heavy development work, no silent upgrade |
| Review | `codex-5.5:high@normal` | Cost-aware cross-review |
| Fast subagent scout | `haiku-4.5@normal` | Read-only discovery and context summaries |
| Subagent routing | `auto` | Choose scout, planner, worker, or checker by task situation |

The routing is stored in `.cross-review/config.json`, so the skill can keep the spec-writing model, heavy-spec model, implementation model, subagent role models, and review model distinct throughout packaging and review.

Detailed model specs use:

```text
<model>[:<axis-a>][@<axis-b>]
```

Examples:

- `codex-5.5:xhigh@normal`
- `codex-5.5:high@priority`
- `opus-4.7:1m@max`
- `sonnet-4.6@high`

Example spec author options:

```json
{
  "model_defaults": {
    "spec": {
      "raw": "codex-5.5:xhigh@normal",
      "provider": "codex",
      "model": "codex-5.5",
      "reasoning": "xhigh",
      "speed": "normal"
    }
  },
  "spec_author_model": "codex-5.5",
  "spec_author_options": {
    "intelligence": "very-high",
    "reasoning": "xhigh",
    "speed": "normal"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "model_defaults": {
    "spec_heavy": {
      "raw": "opus-4.7:1m@max",
      "provider": "claude",
      "model": "claude-opus-4.7",
      "context": "1M",
      "workload": "max"
    }
  },
  "spec_heavy_model": "claude-opus-4.7",
  "spec_heavy_options": {
    "context": "1M",
    "workload": "max"
  }
}
```

UI option mapping:

| UI | Config key | Values |
|----|------------|--------|
| Codex model | `spec_author_model` | `codex-5.5` or `gpt-5.5` for the GPT-5.5 UI entry |
| Codex reasoning | `reasoning` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| Codex intelligence | `intelligence` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very-high` |
| Codex speed | `speed` | `normal`, `fast`, `priority` |
| Claude model | `spec_author_model` or `implementation_model` | `claude-opus-4.7`, `claude-opus-4.7-1m`, `claude-sonnet-4.6`, `claude-haiku-4.5` |
| Claude context | `context` | `standard`, `1M` |
| Claude workload | `workload` | `low`, `normal`, `high`, `max` |

## Automatic subagent routing

The plugin ships Claude Code subagents in `agents/` and can record a routing policy in `.cross-review/config.json`.

| Subagent | Default model | Use for |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `mmr-context-scout` | `haiku` | fast read-only discovery, dependency mapping, task context |
| `mmr-heavy-planner` | `opus` | cross-cutting plans, migrations, ambiguous or security-sensitive work |
| `mmr-implementation-worker` | `sonnet` | scoped implementation and tests |
| `mmr-review-checker` | `sonnet` | local read-only preflight before external review |

When `subagent_routing.mode` is `auto`, tasks can be tagged with route hints such as `[route:scout]`, `[route:heavy-planner]`, `[route:worker]`, or `[route:review-checker]`. The main builder chooses the matching subagent and the configured role model. If Claude Code cannot use a configured non-Claude model in subagent frontmatter, the model stays in the markdown handoff or CLI review path instead of being silently substituted.

## Work-assist orchestration (optional)

For heavy, multi-step work, the skill can drive execution through an optional orchestration and methodology layer when those tools are installed:

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | methodology: brainstorm → plan → execute, TDD, systematic debugging, subagent-driven development |
| UltraWork (`/ulw`, `ultrawork-sanguo`) | dispatcher that auto-routes independent task slices to specialist agents |
| [omo](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) | multi-agent execution harness with model routing and LSP/AST code intelligence |
| [lazycodex](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/lazycodex) | omo's Codex edition for LSP/AST code exploration |

This layer is optional. When the tools are absent it falls back to the plugin's own `mmr-*` subagents or a sequential pass. These are orchestration helpers, **not** token-savers: only RTK and Headroom report measured savings, and the completion footer lists work-assist tools as usage only.

## Compact-first packaging

The package format is now compact-first, inspired by [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk).

Instead of dumping every artifact in full, the default package starts with:

- `SPEC_BRIEF`
- `PLAN_BRIEF`
- `TASKS_BRIEF`
- `RULES_BRIEF`
- `DIFF_MANIFEST`
- `DIFF_EXCERPTS`

This keeps the default handoff much smaller. If the reviewer needs more context, rerun with `--full` or narrow the scope with `--paths`.

Package profiles:

| Profile | Use case |
|---------|----------|
| `micro` | sub-60 second MCP reviews |
| `compact` | default |
| `full` | escalation pass when compact is insufficient |

The package command can also use [Headroom](https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom)
when Headroom MCP tools are available. Headroom is optional and runs after the
normal compact reduction pass, so the package still includes a manifest,
focused excerpts, and `Context sufficiency` guidance.

Headroom modes:

| Mode | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | default; compress large residual blocks when Headroom MCP tools are callable |
| `off` | skip Headroom and use manual summaries only |
| `required` | fail fast if Headroom MCP compression is unavailable |

Details live in [docs/TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md](docs/TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md) and [docs/HEADROOM.md](docs/HEADROOM.md).

### Completion token report

When a flow finishes, the skill ends its response with a measured **Token, Headroom & RTK** footer so you can see what each compression layer saved:

```text
**Token, Headroom & RTK**
- **RTK**: used=<yes|no> — saved ≈ <N> tok (<P>%) · via `rtk gain`
- **Headroom**: used=<yes|no> — saved ≈ <N> tok (<P>%) · via `headroom_stats` / package `compressed_blocks`
- **Combined saved**: ≈ <RTK+Headroom> tok   (only when both layers are measured)
- **Work-assist** (orchestration, usage only): ulw=<used|n/a>, omo=<used|n/a>, lazycodex=<used|n/a>, superpowers=<used|n/a>
- **Subagent routing** (usage only): scout=<used|n/a>, worker=<used|n/a>, heavy-planner=<used|n/a>, review-checker=<used|n/a>
```

RTK (shell-output reduction) and Headroom (context compression) are reported separately and from real statistics only — `rtk gain` and `headroom_stats`/package `compressed_blocks`. A layer that did not engage shows `used=no` rather than an estimated number. The work-assist orchestration tools are listed on their own line as usage only, never as a savings figure.

## Supported reviewers

| Reviewer | Template | Example command |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Claude | `templates/claude-review-prompt.md` | `claude -p "$(cat <pkg>/review-package.md)" > <pkg>/review-report.md` |
| Codex (auto) | `templates/codex-auto-review-prompt.md` | Try MCP first, fall back to CLI on timeout |
| Codex (CLI) | `templates/codex-cli-review-prompt.md` | `codex exec -m codex-5.5 --file <pkg>/review-package.md > <pkg>/review-report.md`; local: `codex exec --oss -m <local-model> --file ...` |
| Codex (MCP) | `templates/codex-mcp-review-prompt.md` | Inline MCP call for tiny packages |
| Gemini | `templates/gemini-review-prompt.md` | `gemini --file <pkg>/review-package.md > <pkg>/review-report.md` |

Adding a reviewer is still a file-only change: add `templates/<reviewer>-review-prompt.md`.

## Codex modes

The `mcp__codex__codex` path is hard-limited to about 60 seconds, so non-trivial reviews should use the CLI path.

| Value | Execution method | Best for |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| `codex-mcp` | inline MCP | tiny validations |
| `codex-cli` | `codex exec -m <review_model> --file ...` | longer reviews |
| `codex-auto` | MCP first, CLI fallback | default |

### Codex OSS/local providers

Codex CLI can run against local OSS providers such as Ollama or LM Studio when Codex is invoked with `--oss`. Configure the default local provider in Codex `config.toml`:

```toml
oss_provider = "ollama" # or "lmstudio"
```

Then run the same review package through the local provider:

```bash
PKG=.cross-review/packages/20260421-1400-auth-rework
codex exec --oss -m <local-model> --file $PKG/review-package.md > $PKG/review-report.md
```

`multi-model-review` keeps `spec_author_model`, `review_model`, and their raw model specs as workflow metadata. Codex runtime provider selection stays in Codex CLI configuration or invocation flags: `--oss`, `oss_provider`, `model_provider`, and `[model_providers.<id>]` are not extra model-axis values. Codex reserves the built-in provider IDs `openai`, `ollama`, and `lmstudio`; do not write those provider IDs into Claude Code subagent frontmatter unless the local Claude Code installation explicitly supports them.

When a local provider's native model ID contains `:`, preserve it as the model ID unless the suffix is one of this extension's known option axes. This avoids stripping local model tags from `codex exec --oss -m <local-model>`.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) 1.x
- `git` on `PATH`
- a reviewer model installed locally:
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), using hosted models or local OSS providers configured in Codex
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - another Claude session
  - a Hermes Agent session (`templates/hermes-review-prompt.md`)
  - any other CLI-capable LLM with a matching template
- a Spec Kit project initialized with `specify init` when installing through `specify extension`

## Install

### Spec Kit Extension

For local development:

```bash
specify extension add --dev /path/to/multi-model-review
specify extension list
```

After a `v0.1.2` release is published, users can install directly from the release archive:

```bash
specify extension add multi-model-review --from https://github.com/formin/multi-model-review/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.2.zip
```

Registered Spec Kit command names:

| Spec Kit command | Legacy Claude plugin command |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| `/speckit.multi-model-review.cross-review` | `/multi-model-review:cross-review` |
| `/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff` | `/multi-model-review:spec-handoff` |
| `/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package` | `/multi-model-review:review-package` |
| `/speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review` | `/multi-model-review:apply-review` |

### Claude Code Plugin

Inside a Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin install multi-model-review@multi-model-review
```

Or at the OS shell:

```bash
claude plugin install multi-model-review@multi-model-review
claude plugin list
```

Then run `/reload-plugins` or restart Claude Code.

## Quick start

Inside your project:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.cross-review init \
  --spec codex-5.5:xhigh@normal \
  --spec-heavy opus-4.7:1m@max \
  --dev sonnet-4.6@high \
  --review codex-5.5:high@normal \
  --subagents auto
```

This writes `.cross-review/config.json`. The same settings can be changed later with:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.cross-review models set --spec codex-5.5:xhigh@normal --spec-heavy opus-4.7:1m@max --dev sonnet-4.6@high --review codex-5.5:high@normal --subagents auto
```

Create a spec-authoring handoff when you want the configured spec model to write or refine the development artifacts:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff 001-auth-rework --spec-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal
```

For a plan-focused pass, keep the same command and add `--plan`:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff "CSP v2 offerId alignment" --plan --spec-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal
```

Then implement your feature as usual and package it:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package --review-model codex-5.5:high@normal
```

Implementation still happens through your normal builder flow, such as `/speckit.implement` or direct edits. When subagent routing is enabled, the generated tasks can carry route hints so Claude Code can delegate scout, planner, worker, and local checker slices to the matching plugin subagent. `multi-model-review` records the configured dev model and refuses silent upgrade in the handoff metadata; it does not add a separate implement slash command.

The plugin writes:

```text
.cross-review/packages/<timestamp>-<slug>/
  review-package.md
  metadata.json
```

Run the reviewer in a separate terminal. Example:

```bash
PKG=.cross-review/packages/20260421-1400-auth-rework
codex exec -m codex-5.5 --file $PKG/review-package.md > $PKG/review-report.md

# Local OSS reviewer via Codex CLI:
codex exec --oss -m <local-model> --file $PKG/review-package.md > $PKG/review-report.md
```

Then ingest the report:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review
```

If the reviewer reports `Context sufficiency: needs-full-package`, rerun:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package --full
```

Or scope it tighter:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package --paths src/auth,src/api
```

### Detailed option examples

Set project defaults with both model axes:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.cross-review init \
  --spec codex-5.5:xhigh@normal \
  --spec-heavy opus-4.7:1m@max \
  --dev sonnet-4.6@high \
  --review codex-5.5:high@normal \
  --subagents auto
```

Write a spec from the user's feature brief with high intelligence and normal speed:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff "CSP v2 offerId alignment" --spec-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal
```

Use the heavy 1M-context spec default for a large audit:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff "DOMAINAPI full SERVER_ADDR branch audit" --heavy
```

Create a plan-focused handoff while preserving the configured implementation model:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff "CSP v2 offerId alignment" --plan --spec-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal
```

Implementation still runs through your normal builder flow, such as `/speckit.implement` or direct edits. The configured default is `sonnet-4.6@high`, and generated metadata records `allow_silent_upgrade=false` so the workflow does not quietly move implementation to a stronger model.

Run cost-aware cross-review:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package C-12 --review-model codex-5.5:high@normal
```

Escalate intelligence for a non-trivial design review:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package L-30 --review-model codex-5.5:xhigh@normal
```

Use priority speed only when review turnaround is the bottleneck:

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package L-50 --review-model codex-5.5:high@priority
```

## Basic usage examples

### Codex 5.5 writes specs, Claude Sonnet 4.6 implements

Use this when you want Codex to spend the deep reasoning budget on durable Spec Kit artifacts, then keep implementation on Sonnet 4.6.

/speckit.multi-model-review.review-package 001-auth-rework --review-model codex-5.5:high@normal
/speckit.multi-model-review.apply-review
```

### Opus 4.7 1M writes specs, Claude Sonnet 4.6 implements

Use this when the spec pass needs the Claude 1M context option and max workload setting.

```text
/speckit.multi-model-review.spec-handoff 001-auth-rework --heavy
```

Equivalent config:

```json
{
  "builder": "claude-code",
  "model_defaults": {
    "spec_heavy": {
      "raw": "opus-4.7:1m@max",
      "provider": "claude",

## Review report contract

All reviewer templates point at the same schema in [templates/review-report.md](templates/review-report.md).

The report now includes:

- `Context sufficiency`
- `Verdict`
- `Summary`
- `Findings`

That extra `Context sufficiency` field is what makes compact-first safe: the reviewer can explicitly ask for a fuller package instead of guessing.

## Design choices

- **No hidden external side calls.** You run external reviewers yourself; Claude Code subagents are local, explicit task delegates.
- **Markdown interchange only.** Packages and reports are plain files.
- **Compact-first.** Small default package, full package on demand.
- **Confidence-gated.** Findings below 70 are hidden by default.
- **Template-driven.** New reviewers require template files, not code.

## Relationship to Spec Kit

This project is complementary to Spec Kit, not a fork of it. Spec Kit remains the lifecycle owner for specification, planning, tasks, and implementation. `multi-model-review` adds the cross-model review loop on top.
