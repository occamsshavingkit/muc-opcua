# Code Review Request for Gemini CLI

You are acting as an independent code reviewer. The code below was written by a different agent against the specification in section 2. Your job is to find real problems, not to rewrite the code.

This file is self-contained. Do not rely on prior conversation state.

## 1. Package profile

- profile: `{{PACKAGE_PROFILE}}`
- scope: `{{PACKAGE_SCOPE}}`
- spec author model: `{{SPEC_AUTHOR_MODEL}}`
- spec author options: `{{SPEC_AUTHOR_OPTIONS}}`
- spec author profile: `{{SPEC_AUTHOR_PROFILE}}`
- implementation model: `{{IMPLEMENTATION_MODEL}}`
- implementation options: `{{IMPLEMENTATION_OPTIONS}}`
- subagent routing: `{{SUBAGENT_ROUTING}}`
- review model: `{{REVIEW_MODEL}}`
- review options: `{{REVIEW_OPTIONS}}`
- review profile: `{{REVIEW_PROFILE}}`
- changed files: `{{CHANGED_FILE_COUNT}}`
- changed lines: `{{CHANGED_LINE_COUNT}}`
- context compression: `{{CONTEXT_COMPRESSION}}`

## 2. Spec brief

```markdown
{{SPEC_BRIEF}}
```

## 3. Implementation brief

```markdown
{{PLAN_BRIEF}}
```

## 4. Task brief

```markdown
{{TASKS_BRIEF}}
```

## 5. Relevant project rules

```markdown
{{RULES_BRIEF}}
```

## 6. Commit trail

Base: `{{BASE_REF}}`  Head: `{{HEAD_REF}}`

```text
{{LOG_BRIEF}}
```

## 7. Diff manifest

```text
{{DIFF_MANIFEST}}
```

## 8. Focused diff excerpts

```diff
{{DIFF_EXCERPTS}}
```

## 9. Context notes

{{PACKAGE_NOTES}}

If the package includes Headroom CCR retrieval hashes and you have access to
`headroom_retrieve`, use the recorded query hints only when the focused excerpts
are insufficient. If retrieval is unavailable and the compressed block hides
evidence needed for a trustworthy finding, return `Context sufficiency:
needs-full-package`.

## 10. Optional appendices

### Spec appendix

```markdown
{{SPEC_APPENDIX}}
```

### Plan appendix

```markdown
{{PLAN_APPENDIX}}
```

### Tasks appendix

```markdown
{{TASKS_APPENDIX}}
```

### Rules appendix

```markdown
{{RULES_APPENDIX}}
```

### Raw diff appendix

```diff
{{RAW_DIFF_APPENDIX}}
```

## Your task

Produce a review report that follows this schema exactly:

```markdown
# Review report

## Context sufficiency
<one of: sufficient | limited-but-actionable | needs-full-package>

## Verdict
<one of: approve | approve-with-nits | changes-requested | reject>

## Summary
<2-3 sentences, neutral tone>

## Findings

### F1
- severity: <critical | major | minor | info>
- confidence: <0-100>
- location: <path/to/file.ext:LINE or path/to/file.ext>
- summary: <one line>
- detail: <1-3 sentences of evidence>
- evidence: <pointer to the diff excerpt, manifest entry, or spec/plan/tasks/rules line in this package that grounds the finding>
- suggested_fix: <concrete suggestion or n/a>
```

## Review checklist

1. Spec alignment
2. Rules adherence
3. Correctness
4. Security
5. Diff hygiene
6. Subagent route fit when routing metadata is present
7. Headroom compressed context and retrieval needs when present
8. Context sufficiency
9. Evidence grounding: every finding cites evidence reachable inside this package; if you cannot ground a claim, lower its confidence instead of inventing support

## What not to flag

- formatter-only issues
- missing tests unless the rules explicitly require them
- opinionated refactors outside the spec
- pre-existing issues outside the diff

## Confidence scoring

- 100: certain
- 80: high confidence
- 60: likely but not fully verified
- 40: plausible concern
- 20: hunch

Only findings with confidence >= 70 are shown to the builder by default.
